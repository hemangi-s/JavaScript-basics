 # Control Flow in JavaScript

## Introduction
Control flow in JavaScript involves directing the order in which your program's statements are executed. This is achieved through the use of control flow structures such as `if` statements, `switch` statements, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `forEach`), and `break` and `continue` statements.

## `if` Statement
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. The syntax of an `if` statement is as follows:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

For example, consider the following code:

```javascript
let isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
  console.log("Take an umbrella!");
} else {
  console.log("Enjoy the weather!");
}
```

In this example, if the `isRaining` variable is `true`, the code inside the `if` block will be executed, and the message "Take an umbrella!" will be printed to the console. If `isRaining` is `false`, the code inside the `else` block will be executed, and the message "Enjoy the weather!" will be printed to the console.

## `switch` Statement
The `switch` statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable. The syntax of a `switch` statement is as follows:

```javascript
switch (variable) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if variable is equal to value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if variable is equal to value2
    break;
  default:
    // code to be executed if variable does not match any of the cases
}
```

For example, consider the following code:

```javascript
let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("Start of the week");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("End of the week");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Midweek blues");
}
```

In this example, the `day` variable is assigned the value "Monday". The `switch` statement checks the value of the `day`

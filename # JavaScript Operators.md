 # JavaScript Operators

This JavaScript code demonstrates various types of operators used to perform operations on values. It includes examples and explanations for each type of operator.

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric values.

### Examples:

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 4;

let sum = a + b;   // Addition
let difference = a - b;   // Subtraction
let product = a * b;   // Multiplication
let quotient = a / b;   // Division
let remainder = a % b;   // Modulus
let exponentiation = a ** b;   // Exponentiation
```

## 2. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).

### Examples:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = "5";

let isEqual = x == y;     // Equal (loose equality, type coercion)
let isStrictEqual = x === y;    // Strict Equal (strict equality, no type coercion)
let isNotEqual = x != y;   // Not Equal (loose inequality, type coercion)
let isNotStrictEqual = x !== y;   // Strict Not Equal (strict inequality, no type coercion)

let greaterThan = x > y;    // Greater Than
let lessThan = x < y;       // Less Than
let greaterOrEqual = x >= y;   // Greater Than or Equal To
let lessOrEqual = x <= y;      // Less Than or Equal To
```

## 3. Logical Operators

Logical operators perform logical operations on boolean values and return a boolean result.

### Examples:

```javascript
let p = true;
let q = false;

let andOperator = p && q;   // Logical AND
let orOperator = p || q;    // Logical OR
let notOperator = !p;       // Logical NOT
```

## 4. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to variables.

### Examples:

```javascript
let z = 10;

z += 5;   // Equivalent to: z = z + 5 (Addition assignment)
z -= 3;   // Equivalent to: z = z - 3 (Subtraction assignment)
z *= 2;   // Equivalent to: z = z * 2 (Multiplication assignment)
z /= 4;   // Equivalent to

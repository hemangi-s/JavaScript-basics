 # Objects and Arrays in JavaScript

## Introduction

Objects and arrays are fundamental data structures in JavaScript. They allow you to organize and store data in a structured way. This guide will provide a detailed explanation of objects and arrays, including their declaration, accessing and modifying properties, adding and removing elements, and iterating through them.

## Objects

### 1. Object Declaration

Objects are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is a string that represents the property name, and each value can be of any type, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other objects.

```javascript
// Object Declaration
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    zipCode: "10001"
  }
};
```

In this example, the `person` object has four properties: `name`, `age`, `isStudent`, and `address`. The `address` property is itself an object with two properties: `city` and `zipCode`.

### 2. Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties using dot notation or square brackets. Dot notation is preferred when the property name is a valid JavaScript identifier, while square brackets are useful when the property name is a string or contains special characters.

```javascript
// Accessing Object Properties
console.log(person.name);             // Output: John
console.log(person["age"]);           // Output: 30
console.log(person.address.city);     // Output: New York
```

### 3. Modifying Object Properties

Object properties can be modified after creation by simply assigning a new value to the property.

```javascript
// Modifying Object Properties
person.age = 31;
person["isStudent"] = true;
```

### 4. Adding and Removing Object Properties

You can add new properties to an object or delete existing ones using the dot notation or square brackets.

```javascript
// Adding and Removing Object Properties
person.gender = "Male";
delete person.isStudent;
```

## Arrays

### 1. Array Declaration

Arrays are ordered lists of values. Each element in an array is accessed by its index, which starts from 0.

```javascript
// Array Declaration
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange
